## Ideas for Improvement:

### 1. Accessibility Enhancements:
- Add `aria-labels` or `aria-labelledby` for inputs and navigation links.
- Ensure color contrasts meet accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG compliance).

### 2. Responsive Design:
- Enhance mobile and tablet layouts with media queries to ensure all sections (especially the menu and recipes) display seamlessly.

### 3. Dynamic Features:
- Add a dynamic "Today's Special" section updated using JavaScript or integrated with a CMS.
- Use a carousel for the menu or featured recipes.

### 4. Add Reviews or Testimonials:
- Include a section for customer reviews with a submission form and moderation functionality.

### 5. Modern Animations:
- Use CSS animations for subtle effects, like fading in the recipes section or highlighting menu items on hover.
